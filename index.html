        <p>Hi, my name is Ariel Astudillo, I am currently a student at the All star code program and a rising junior. Ever since when I was a kid I loved playing video games up until where technology is getting to my interests, I have an older brother who also participated in the All star code program which technically means that I am following his footsteps.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>What I like to do besides All star code is hanging out and spending time with friends and family, I also play volleyball at the park every afternoon and workout at the gym. I also play video games whenever I stay home. It is always okay to go outside and get fresh air.</p>
